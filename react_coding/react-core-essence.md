## Essence of React.js

In one sentence, React.js is a declarative UI library that enables building user interfaces through composable components and reactive data flow. When using this, follow below philosophies.

- [ ] **Deeply understand rendering behaviors**: Master how state updates trigger re-renders, how they propagate through component trees, and the differences between Elements and Components. Understanding mount/unmount cycles and React's reconciliation algorithm is fundamental to performance optimization.

- [ ] **Pursue declarative UI and component-based design**: Focus on describing the desired final state of UI rather than imperative DOM manipulation. Break down applications into small, reusable, and testable components that encapsulate markup, logic, and styling.

- [ ] **Master state and side effect management**: Control state lifecycles accurately to prevent incorrect data display, infinite loops, and performance issues. Side effects should always be managed and synchronized with React's lifecycle to prevent leaks and race conditions.

- [ ] **Establish dynamic data flow patterns**: Utilize React's state mechanisms actively for UI changes and user interactions. Apply reactive data flow concepts where UI automatically updates when data changes, choosing optimal state management strategies based on application scale.

- [ ] **Implement data fetching strategies and error handling**: Avoid waterfall phenomena through parallel fetching, resolve race conditions with proper cleanup patterns, and establish comprehensive error boundaries to maintain application stability.

- [ ] **Pursue code quality and performance optimization continuously**: Enforce consistent code style with linters, write comprehensive tests, measure performance bottlenecks, and apply optimizations based on actual measurements rather than assumptions.
